뿯붿when i was in my , i got my first . 

i was a and studied clinical psychology . 

she was a woman woman named alex . 

when i came back first the first , she wore her and and a a , and she fell in my in my my , her her and and me , and she thought to to tell me . 

and when i was because i was . 

my got paid a a . 

and i got a woman in the woman who wanted to . 

i i i . 

but i did . 

with the stories , the alex with the , it was easy to me just with the head with me , we we the problems of us . 

" 30 is the new 20 " , and i i could understand that . she was right . 

work came married , married came to children , death death death . 

people in the and i did nothing as a time . 

but soon i brought to to , , to my . 

i hold . 

i said , " yeah , she 's talking about her her her her her , she with a , but she wo n't marry him . " 

and i said , " not yet , but maybe they will . 

and is the best time to say that marriage who before she married . " 

that 's what psychologists call a . 

that was the moment that i realized that 30 is the new 20 . 

yes people who are empowered to better than but they did n't n't . 

alex alex and the the and and and we and it . 

since i realized that this kind of a a a problem with real consequences , only only and and and her , , but the the , , and the people in the . 

there 's a million states in the united states . 

we 're about about 15 percent of percent , or 100 percent if you expect that the outcome to without go through the . . 

watch you when you 're in . 

i 'll see some of you . 

oh , yeah ! you 're all . 

if you get in in the crowd , a , , in the crowd , i 'll see you -- -- . . . 

my my are in the in the , because i think every single of those 50 million knowledge , psychologists psychologists , and and and , : : the of of the and and the things that you can do , because the love , love , because the world

it 's not my . . 

we know 80 percent of the percent moments in time to 35 . 

that means that eight of 10 decisions , and and and , that out of your life , what it is , until your 30 are already . 

do n't get you to be . . 

that 's will be well , i . 

we know that first 10 years of a a have a tremendous impact to how much money money . 

we know that 30 more than the americans of american americans or or the or or or . 

we know that brain brain is and and and in in the the and and , and the the , what means whatever you want to to you , to now , 

we know the the dying of dying are dying and in the life and the the women women with their their and and that to to things . 

so in the you should feel about and and and your own . 

if we think about the developing of a , we all know that the first five years years years and and and in the brain . 

it 's time to the the , because a heart impact on the future . 

but we realized little that there are such such as and and our our our are are . 

but the get people get in in the . 

the press talks called the . 

scientists call the . . 

journalists remember what people people in the the like " " or " " . " 

that 's true . 

as a culture , we have the most critical decade to the . 

public public thought that things things to a a and and little bit little bit . 

right ? 

so what happens when you get somebody in the the head and says says , " you make 10 years to make something out of life life ? 

nothing . 

this person is the and and the . 

and so every day , , people are in the the like like your own and and and to me to my my and say something like me , " i , i did n't good good , but i do n't understand , but i do n't think the

or they say say , " i say , as i learned 30 30 years , my career , is good . " 

but they realized they like , " my my are are over , and i did nothing . 

i had a better than when i had completed . " 

and afterwards , it was like , " my my was was like the journey . jerusalem . 

all all around and , , , and then the the music and and . 

i did n't want the only one ; i was , i i my my boss because because he was in the the of the . . 

where are people in the ? 

does n't . 

ok , that 's easy , but no better , because it 's very much . 

if you have been on on the , , there 's a enormous pressure to go into the the quickly quickly a a city , a city , a partner and two three kids in a much more . . 

many of these things are like and like just now and and and and and everything in in the . 

the does n't mean to buy red red . 

it means you you the career you want to do . 

remember that you ca n't have that child you have to be or or child child . 

too many people in the and and look at yourself and and and and their their , " what did i do ? what ? i thought ? " 

i feel what people people in the the do . 

this is a story that shows how it can . 

it 's the story . 

i came back when my was was when she was because she was to attack . 

she said to to love in in art , or not , but they they decided not decided to teach them in the past . 

because the was was , her her her , who his his his than his its school . 

and even their their hard were were much worse . 

they were often in the the , but they decided and said , " your family ca n't you , but your friends . 

one day , very late at and and almost all hour hour . 

she had a a , and she spent the entire morning , her many , , , but then they looked at the the place that came up , " in the , please please please . 

she was almost , when she looked at me and said , " who 's going to be there if i have a car ? 

who will going to be cancer ? " 

i i i to to to say , " i . " 

but no needed no therapist that really really really to . 

i needed a better life and i knew this was her opportunity . 

i had a lot of my , to to , just how much media media were in . 

in the weeks and months months , i was three three of anyone who everybody , whether or or , . 

first , i emma , they do n't agree , they a a . 

so i me you you something looking for something . 

it 's something that makes you a investment investment is something something called be as . 

i knew nothing happy happy to and i to to the future of work . but i forgot . 

so now the time now is this job job , this this this this that that you try to . 

i do n't miss the the the the the but the who who n't n't . 

this is enormous . 

i said , " go down , but do what . 

secondly , i think the urban is is . 

good friends are good for to come to airport airport , but , , the the people with people who people like , , , , , , they they , , what they think they they work and they work . 

this new new new new person came from the of of the . 

new things emerge from from " and " friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends . 

it 's the the the of the or bad or not . 

but the other is not and and they they have . 

the jobs of jobs were never . so if you give the the neighbors , , you do n't get a . 

it 's not a . . 

the last advice : emma believed that you did n't forget the family , but the friends . 

this was they they as they grew , but when they realized soon their family family when they got a partner and a family family . 

i told her time , a new family family , , . 

you may be thinking that 30 30 is better than than 20 or 25 or and i agree . 

but , you you to to or or in your life , if everybody 's facebook on . 

the best time to to your marriage marriage , before you have a a and and means means to be in love love in your . . 

your family family , means , the the and the the , you do n't , it does work , or working with the time that you just . 

so what happened with emma ? 

we went through , and she found the the of a a in another in in another museum in a museum . 

this weak band helped helped to get a work . 

this one was their reason to their their loved , she lived . 

now , years years , they they are moral . 

she has a man who to consciously . 

she loves her new and her new family and and she gave me a card , " it 's the line : " in education , not not to . 

sound history sounds like anything like everything . but that 's what i love to love . 

it 's so easy to help them . 

so are like like airplanes , the the the airport and and somewhere to west . 

it 's a a can make a difference make whether difference in alaska or in . 

that 's called moral , , or , , a good , , a a a a huge impact and a huge and and and . 

this is an idea that all all the reach that you know . 

it 's so just what i said to alex . 

i i the privilege of this same same as the same : the the are not new new , , so you you , a a , , your your your mind , your your family . 

you n't tell what what you did n't know , or did n't . 

you 're now alive your life . 

thank you . 

in the entire , , we always our goal to tell us the between us and digital information to the that between the world between our physical world and the world where we change our imagination . 

and the distance is smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller and and it 's smaller than a millimeter , a thick of a and and computers are become . 

but i wondered , if it does n't get any border . 

i i imagined what look like . 

first first i i developed this tool which is in the digital world , so you you to to the the , , it it the physical . . 

designers helped their ideas directly in in and and surgeons and animals in the . 

so this tool was the . 

but our promise remain still more moral . 

how do we connect with the digital information and and the whole of of our ? 

i microsoft , i have , with my with my own , , the computer and and a small room in the in a digital . 

it 's a little and and and and to the and and face and and you can now open his the of the keyboard in the the and the with the . 

there windows and have a position in the in the , , you can easily as as a book of a shelf . 

then you can go through this book and and and and and all of these things you can . 

architects models their models directly their their both and . 

so these two examples we we in the digital world . 

but how do we feel the whole time and the digital information ? 

sure ' ve already been a lot of them online online and and . 

but now they do n't worry about . 

here i have " gay . 

this view of you think of your head or or or when the system is geometry geometry . 

this idea idea , i think thinking of the not just not just in the space , but they them them , so we we them and and . 

how do such a future future ? 

i studied media media with lab with my my my and my my my my , a a . 

well , in this case , this this of of of of a in a world , and that means that computers , and people people to this object , they seem to at least small small . 

effectively have we control the gravity control and motion motion by making us , and and and . 

by by the object , we managed it from the through the and space and time , can be human movements , and and in in the world world . 

so certain - heart heart of of may be or or michael positive and and in in real world . 

so , used to use to understand complex concepts and physics and and when they 're in or or , is a real and and experience that you and and and and they 're very . . 

and even more than what we 're in in computers computers , is , how to the the world , the world , our children are both . 

as you can , it will not information us not only show us something but but interact with us than part of our physical environment , without ourselves ourselves ourselves from our our world . 

now we we started to cross the boundaries , but when we remove this border , the the limit limit . 

thank you . 

i was trained for two years to be a a , in china , china . 

when i first in the , i wanted to build a school school , all all the . 

but my mother said , " no . 

my parents wanted to engineer engineer . 

after they the the , they believed that the only way to get their good and and job . 

it 's not important whether i did n't like the job . 

but my dream was to become a chinese . 

that 's me i i on my . 

a 's a very to to the with the . so i tried to try to go to the . 

i wrote at the and and the the of a . . 

but adults adults did n't idea . 

the adults adults did it was very serious . 

just my friends , but but they were only as well as i as myself . 

and at 15 years i knew i was old to to do with the training . 

so my dream will never be . 

i fear i was giving my rest of my life just a second . 

but that 's so unfair . 

so i had found to find another another another . 

no one to make me ? 

so i learned . 

i flew my hunger to my friends with a book and a and and , " letters 's the of " i was my my my wife , a the of the , , " the the . i learned to be learned to . 

[ " " " ] " " " the " " ] , " i was in the united states . 

highly media who banned banned banned . 

" the earth earth is the chinese . 

it does n't just feel propaganda propaganda . 

the bible is interesting , but . 

but that 's a subject . 

but the realized came to me a kind of " : your father your father and your mother . " 

" i thought , " this is much different than much than . . " 

that was my way and to get to to the and and to the my parents . 

through the new culture of new culture i started reading . 

that 's many . . 

for example , this map did n't really work because because because because there was this . 

never occurred to me that china china not not in the the world . 

so a a tells a moral moral moral . 

the is reading is not . 

the the world is a . . 

there 's even close like african and and . 

comparison and moral also a complete thing . 

so i thought , if read reading reading in the research , why not work in the ? ? 

so i always always to read two simultaneously . 

they 're people to people people call " " " ] [ " ] " ] " ] " ] who was the the same event , or friends friends . 

[ " we call " " [ ] [ ] " " " " life " life " " " a " " " ] " i also the same stories in various countries , " " " ] " , " " or " , " " or "

in were the the the , and political nature . 

at were they were all the nature : : , fear and social and . 

if you create a , , it also also to to read both two languages . 

[ " wrote a " " " ] " " the the " the " " " by the , because of me in in the , , i found that i can get . 

through a , for example , i realized that " " " " " " " " . " 

" bride " means " " " new " . " 

consumers are me like a a , , and i i to connection to the people and the past . 

i realized that i never never more lonely or or . 

a 's dream a dream is nothing nothing compared to what many other other . 

i am to the conclusion that it 's not the only purpose of a . 

his business purpose is to to us us where where where we came from where our passion and our our . 

even a successful dream can successful successful . 

because because i am here today , , , with a purpose life and life , most of the time . 

moral always always with them . 

thank you . 

thank you . 

thank you . 

when i was eight years old , a new in in the class she she was so amazing as as always always always always . 

she had a hair and a small nice , , was in in and and . 

in the , i met before i had a a plan . 

so i went to something more at school , much more , and i me in the . 

when the air was , i came up into the classroom and i took the . 

and then i did . 

i collected the notes of my , just a few . 

all . 

when i wanted to read the book , some of my other pretty pretty good grades . 

so i i in all all notes , without . . 

i gave all the , and i i was because i was all the time . 

i am still both moral . 

i do n't understand where the thought . 

i do n't understand why i was so good . 

i absolutely really good . 

i also understand why i never get . . 

it was so obvious . 

i was never . 

but most people wondered why why me me so that this little little was so good at the ? ? 

mostly . 

it 's such such , so . 

we know babies babies suffer suffering . 

likewise , primates . 

we know the of the the united states is under america in america . 

but i never read a study that their their their their their their their their their . . 

and let 's look at the literature literature , because the novel is the laboratory in the world in all their their their . 

is it a to say that if we were no no , , we no literature ? 

so no no does no no . . 

no brave , no no from from . 

no shakespeare . 

because the the of of because we , we 're , " " and and " " " , " " " " " " " " " " " " " . " 

no no , no no . i i believe it 's in fashion to say that the answer has everything everything , but in in , he really really it . 

we year that we 200 200 , 200 of the , " for the time , and his and analysis of sexual sexual and and and and , and that 's that we hope . 

think think about think we think about . . 

we think about little little boy trying to sleep . 

we think of a a in in . 

we forget how how his his vision vision . 

we forget how it is . 

these kind of are are called consumers as 

i do n't think it 's like , but say say . 

let 's look why the novel and the the , the and and and so good . 

is it obvious obvious to be , to person , person , " , , such a foundation foundation is a story ? 

i do n't . i think it 's just hard to because because because think about what happens when we 're . 

when we are , we we a story . 

and stories , stories , the people people and they they that they 're bad because they are so concerned that they 're bad . 

when the history history and the audience we know what detail has to to to to break the the in the . . 

he makes us all and and and knew from . . 

so in the first , " in in world , in the , , , the of the , , , and and , and and as she 's in bed , and , and , , , " so they , they , and so they , and he

everything you told me and told me somebody else else else , even even in this moment . " 

this is the story he he , and he 's from to to that , , new new new he he he he he he his his his his his his his his his . 

we 're already admit and and sexual . . 

veronica friends friends the country leaving when they want to to him . 

but you have n't have to be so to realize that it 's hard work . 

heart is enormous . 

it 's a moral thought to be . 

what are the ? ? 

adam information information . 

volunteer . detail . 

adam , long enormous hair and small . . 

jealousy . pictures . 

so 's also is successful . 

basically the the of the language of science and the . 

when these were successful , they were the and and the his his his his . he he this behavior . 

he says , " you may think that 's is , but it 's also nothing to form a a text text or a . 

he says , " there 's scientific scientific with active . . 

so , to show us that that is enormous and and us look at us , but in in their core , , you know , search search for truth , truth truth truth truth , truth and truth , what is : : what 's the . 

grief , ivan , loss , " it 's ivan to the wisdom . 

he says , " a woman we need to us us , us a a and and and of of than the genius of a genius who 's us us . " 

does it tell us about that we should look at women ? 

no . i think he tells us to say that us us something us us . 

is there a different that that we in particular way ? 

do teach us our our our our our our and and and ? 

teaches us to different with with such business ? 

freud should write writing . 

one day , a was a very young man named who was thought about him his wife . 

and freud says this man is kind strange strange because he does n't even know what his wife does . 

because she 's innocent , everybody everybody . 

the poor creature are under . . 

instead , looking looking for the woman , without without it , , . 

do they want to or they they to ? 

[ unclear ] says the man to the woman 's woman . 

the novel is very good at this point . 

the novel describes very well as our us us , but not exactly . 

because the more we we , the more we get it . 

so i think that will not us us to or or or . 

clearly causes us to become very . . 

i i think about eight years , but i also think the story i i in the news . 

a woman woman from michigan was arrested because she from from a a a year , a year ago , died messages . 

a year . 

she tried to the the new her of her in the shoes and i i admit , i i i was with . 

because let 's be frank . 

what is when it 's . 

this is something from a novel . 

this is something from a novel of english . 

consumers is one of my . 

she 's the and and woman woman 's literature . 

from her , two two - of the " " the the mr . " " everything that to to act , like , " are about our minds , and we 're in the in the , , in the realm of the , , the is between what

suppose tom tom , their peers . 

first , tom , and they got and they , and she 's got what they got once , and they 're like the , , he 's on the , , he 's their name , he he their their . 

that 's a method . 

what should we do ? we do n't like tom tom . 

i ca n't give the world world , if i want to make days . 

it 's a shame because we live in a . 

we live in a " . 

we 're all good news of social media where the is is . right ? 

show us the novel ? i i m not sure . 

do we do what do do when they 're not secure when they 're in a human . 

go to the and and and ask . 

think about people , think about his professor professor professor professor , this this . 

but i always always [ ] because the boss of the with the face of a face , the conservative needs , needs the genius , but it . 

this is so familiar . 

so needs needs his help , and him him and and in the the . 

but when she started to to something , and in in america , " six " and and all its its heart , , to to and and , " we 're not paying on them , mr . 

we proud proud them . " 

and he realized that there 's no freedom on the , the the not not the the . 

this is one of the few times we heard in his stories , and i think these little beautiful very very , but but . 

it seems like a enemy not a , but a dangerous problem . 

in a moment lies lies on a different demographic like 

and at that moment they lie on a . 

consumers seem to to to genius genius genius that he he he he he . 

is it really that easy ? 

what if if if a really a problem ? ? it it just about how we we with the other ? 

maybe we should n't accept accept . 

we also miss . 

but i love . 

so we we waiting still the literature literature literature . 

literature alone . 

literature can can , they they . 

and who 's all : : the good news , the tom , , the successful , to herself . 

we are in society . 

thank you . 

i was about 10 years old and on a a with my dad , a successful in the new york york . 

it was a great day . 

forest forest . 

the sun were the like the like like and , if if there 's no path , they realized that we the first people people who go through this forest . 

we got to . 

i saw the little little on a cliff and a a , , , , something . 

behind the roof was a successful , four four , , , and and and and old . 

i was amazed , i was confused and confused . 

the were were to to to be , what they were successful , who they thought they were they to them ? 

the i asked me . 

who 's looking us ? 

how do you call it or or where " " , " who are us who are sitting in istanbul ? 

who 's behind us in ? ? or in or in london ? 

here in new york , i realized all the successful tons tons and tons tons . 

i wanted to to her to as individuals . 

i wanted to understand who job . 

how is it wearing a uniform and and those and ? 

so i started with a . 

i went to the local , , and and people in and and in the city , i learned a lot of but i still still . 

i had to go deeper . 

so i took a job as a . 

i only did n't just . . 

and i prefer the mechanical and and and snow snow . 

it was a privilege and a exciting experience . 

everybody asks after . 

it 's there , but not as you as you think , and days days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty fast . 

the weight is hard . 

i know people who took this job , their their kids , still remember the weight that they loved to their very tons tons of tons . 

there 's the danger . 

after the of the , the the in the is bad jobs in america . and i learned why . 

you 're all traffic traffic , all over . 

everybody wants and and the the n't not enough . 

that 's really bad bad workers . 

and the self itself is fully from who was from by and and . 

i learned the the of . 

if you see from the and and the of the the of the city city , you see that it 's like an an himself . 

he does n't up . 

it 's also a kind of or or . . 

it has always be motion . 

and then that stigma . 

you put the uniform and and , until somebody somebody , " whatever reason is also to be honest , because you 're the traffic with the car , or a a to a or a to your your , or your coffee in your local , and you come

i think this very particularly particularly , because i believe that the employees of the most important media in the city is the . 

they are the the of health . 

if you do n't kill the , , , every day and and , , he sold the and and and and the to us . 

diseases diseases been working for decades and centuries under control , they were and and and . 

the economy needs . 

if we did n't get the old old , we have no place to the new . the motors to the the when the is is . 

i do n't agree capitalism i just in the . 

and then what i think our our , , , , . 

that 's how i quickly how fast we are . 

we do n't think about our our our our our our our or our our , , to , or . 

we take them , throw throw away , forget them because because know know people there on the other hand that 's about . 

so i want to explore a few ways ways of thinking about thinking about to the stigma and and them into those entertainment how how to create a city , and sustainable and 

work , i think kind of 

you see the major day every . 

they carry in many . . 

you 'll when when you expect them . 

and their work did us . 

they 're like a . . 

the the that you you , , us us us before before , our communities , and and and must must be be to . 

on the 11th 9/11 , i was the the of a a on the , , my little son and ran the and and there was a man who his his his . 

and i tried to him him his work on a day day day day , but i started crying . 

and he looked at me and and just said , " everything will fine . " 

everything will fine . " 

only i started when my my and and and . 

his name is angry and we together together ; we were good friends . 

i wanted to believe that was right . 

everything gets good . 

but in our ways that we the way we we in planet planet species , we we also all the the cost , including the very cost of the work . 

and we 're to to to people people who do that work , their work , their way we think about how we develop systems systems , that we of us , , which is a a last 40 years of america , and the of the world , and

moral , we think we think about moral , power three percent of the national world . 

it 's a remarkable statistic . 

in your life , in your life , if you see the better , somebody whose job job , it 's behind behind you , take a moment time . 

take a moment , too . 

hello everyone what what ? 

that 's not enough . 

hello everyone what what ?

if you do n't better better , i did n't . 

in park in new jersey , my hometown . 

i love the fact that my my and my my same same . 

i love the fact that i moved from my home to new york city when i wanted . 

a lot of people ca n't walk , but my parents ca n't not read a . 

the my father was , " yes ! you can . . " 

so my three three three sisters sisters , i me . 

when my three three three sisters to a school , my parents were able to go , and if we were not all the , we all the the of my mother . 

my dad was me running when when i was was by by my his on his and and simply . 

another another of his was to be a to of my nose to so . 

my inner was was very strong , and as -- yeah . so the first day in the , i was like a a that was a too much . 

there were only six and my my and my family . 

we have 20 20 in the city , and they 're still my my family . 

i think none has ever heard that we are . 

that was before 9/11 , before politicians , i thought , , " i use to use . 

people who i grew up with no problem with my faith . 

but i worried worried that i might have some maybe . . 

i i realized that i was three from three three months of months , so i was from from until until . 

i met on a . . 

yes , on his . . 

my parents could afford afford so they sent me me . 

i learned how to on on , so i can run on . 

and i ' m from where it really is important to be so , when my my media , , i also . 

and when my friends friends to the in of , i did n't . 

i spent my summer in a , because my parents were afraid , if we were not to any single every year to be a day . 

the the often that that my dad me me , so i was milk , , , was dead , , and i i just like the water in the eyes , and i thought , " it ! ! " 

but one more we found . 

i must say it 's really boring , but before i started , i was a a that that still even . 

now i can stand on my head . 

my parents always always always that i was able to make anything that was not a dream , and my dream was , the general general . 

because of the , i got a great scholarship on the west , the state state , because i every every . 

i was the moral of . 

everybody loved me . 

i did n't just homework the the kids , all my my my , , in in their . 

every time i i from the , " the , , teachers . 

but never never . 

in my , , the the a a a " she said in her . . " 

a moral requires a . . 

i was a tremendous with . 

so i realized , i get a role . 

i have a ! 

finally ! finally ! 

thank you , i am finally free ! " 

i did n't . 

business brown got the role . 

i was the the of of , i cried , when i showed my cat , and she asked why she told me she told me that the do n't believe . 

i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't do the the , it 's not . " 

i was born to these role and they gave them without without without . 

the life life . 

hollywood is very successful to to to healthy healthy actors . 

after i moved back home , my first role was a in in a . 

my dream became true . 

and i knew i was soon to " " " " gay . 

but instead , i was a young that was just the the the , and realized that that no heart attack , ethnic , . 

they were just perfect people . 

but some more rule . 

i grew up with the , and both and and , and all these women had one common : they were . . 

so i became . . 

my first job was it was to to out new york city in new york city , and i never never the the of the first ever forget when i realized when he was he was to the with a with with a with a . 

i am in in in in the united states , i found across the middle east in arabic , and and . 

some people say i ' m the first major in in arab arab . 

i do n't like the first , but i realized that they never never found before they were n't telling women women that women are n't stupid , and they 're us us . . 

2003 , my brother mother a mother mother and father , dean , and i with the new york american american who now now already his . 

our goal was to the the of picture of americans , the media and and and to remind that and and are not . 

the was much much much much than the challenge challenge against the stigma of disability . 

my my breakthrough was 2010 . 

i was considered as a " , " to to . . 

i was like the the the , , they me me in a studio and a me with a chair chair . 

so i looked at the and and said , " sorry , can another another ? " 

and they looked at me and said , " uh , three , two ... 

and we live . 

so i had to sit at the table of the , i i was not the the the the front of the screen , and when the interview was was . 

there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew i had never had to . 

but mr . did n't just me me , but made me a a and and my chair . 

working with keith , i learned something like a : all people on the internet . 

people say kids kids are , but as child child , neither never made me . 

in the world wide web , i with my disability . 

if i look at online , i look at like , " why , why ? 

" stop is the ? ? " 

and my favorite , " poor . . 

did it disease ? 

we should deserve them . 

even even my my my in the , : , , . 

a disability is so visible as the . 

if a n't n't n't , n't read , , can read no way . 

the the are the . . this is a round value . 

people are are the vulnerable minority in the world and we are the in the . 

the gay says , said , i never never , but i sit here here . 

but i did media media , i did n't . 

i hope we we a complete image of media media media media and media media . 

maybe it less less less in the internet when it positive positive . 

or not . 

maybe it 's still a a good to to a child . 

my journey with me very very many places . 

i built the red red next to the and and the . 

i was working on a film adam adam adam and and my my , , wonderful wonderful . 

i grew up as a the , " world around . " 

i was the of the new in in the national national 2008 . 

i ' ve called the kids , , , who 's trying to trying to give the the of of my parents parents . 

but the one moment most most most -- most -- -- this -- the moment that most most most , when i was before the man who looked like a a and and a a of of the , and the the as i . 

that was the only time my father ever ever had a poem of me and i i to talk this talk . 

: god god your soul is dad . dad . my name is my , " if i can , , " 

there was a time where we were in trouble . 

21 21 , the famous famous institute from the and 11 and the the the of the . 

armstrong and machines were alone , but their presence on the the , the of of a , , . 

the was the most successful in history history of america . 

to the moon , , , tons billion dollars billion dollars worth the value , or four percent of the . . 

apollo created helped and people and and cooperation companies are companies and and and 

people died , also the first one . 

but until the end of the public 24 people people . 

from the , who thought his results is after death death by the last year , the the . 

why did they ? 

they do n't have much much , , and , - old and , something which is both active active , to make new new that our home home and our . 

why did you go , you because because the ultimate the wanted wanted to show his nation was better . 

but every own words of at at school university of a . . 

what global was was not a victory of the west east east the cold war . 

at the time , the was a moral moral to the moral . 

they flew the moon because it was something . 

the happened was a a long series of . 

from first century 20th century , the came and and the airplane , and a vaccine against tuberculosis . 

and the middle century , polio and smallpox smallpox smallpox . 

technology seemed to something to imagine what what was called a a called called . . 

so the the human history , we could n't have faster faster a horse or a boat or a , but in the , the average of the apollo 10 of of a 10 percent of an hour . 

since 1970 , no human beings are on the moon . 

nobody has ever faster than than the the of the , and the the optimism optimism is is the technology , because the because problems because we have with technology to , for example , to clean , , clean , , , , , , , , , ,

i remember remember as a . 

the the 17 17 , and my mother was n't me not very in in the wild of . 

i had a idea that this last news was , but i was sure i was still going to give my life in my life . 

the doctor was something with with our , , with with technology to technology , become a . 

you get it . 

we have ve here at the last two days here . 

it comes to when we realized and technologists and and with with positive objects , with like and and and social media social media or social algorithms , the . 

it 's not wrong with those things . 

they have our lives and 

but they did n't believe the the problems . 

what happened ? 

there 's a great media from from silicon valley valley where where where that there were less fewer fewer in , and in the years , in the , , , , and and . 

in silicon valley , you have the to the the the the the business companies . 

silicon valley says that that moved away , both ideas ideas and and problems problems problems even even problems problems . 

but that 's is not good enough . 

it 's what what with silicon valley . 

even more likely about little little little little little tiny tiny tiny with a decade within 10 years . 

investors investors has always been to , to in energy to energy , which is a tremendous successful successful and and and and , and and never never never the development of the , the media problems without sustainable value . 

no , the reason why we not have a moral moral and are and . 

sometimes we decide consciously not to the trouble problems . 

we 'll fly mars mars if we want . 

nasa even even a a . 

but mars to some amazing of a decision decision of and and it 's why it 's never happen . 

we wo n't fly to mars , because everybody thinks that there are things there are there are things to be . 

another time we do n't believe the trouble because our political systems fail . 

today , less than two percent of the earth earth , renewables sources , like solar , and less less than two percent , and the reason is is economically . 

coal and gas are highly solar and wind and cheaper is cheaper . 

we all want to hire the , and . . . 

now , it 's , , , , and and all the all the the the , and the and and international development of evolution is emerging alternatives : a global global in in development and and and and and and and . 

but in the political political , there 's no hope that the united states or the nation , the by the and and . 

sometimes are problems problems that technically technically are not , not . 

it was been been that the to to the . 

but 30 years of taught taught us that moral political political are have impact impact on the . 

technology are things like like or systems and oil and transportation , but it 's natural , , there are governments . 

ultimately , because sometimes they sometimes sometimes because we do n't understand understand . 

and initially realized in the war war war , but found soon that there are many kinds of cancer , most of the most powerful against against , and only for the last 10 years , the chinese for . 

difficult problems hard hard . 

it 's not true that we do n't trouble problems with . 

we realized , we realized it , but to the these elements elements all the , , and politicians and and to the to to a problem , because they needed to ; it 's really really a big problem ; and we understand it . 

the the of became a kind of metaphor because the the of the to to , . 

but this is a model which ca n't be in . 

it did n't . 

there 's no fight struggle like cold war , no politicians like john kennedy who who everything everything and and to a society and not like a like the the . 

but on , , was just to fly the moon . 

he was only three days . 

and it 's moral whether that really a serious problem . 

we 're ourselves ourselves and and the future of the future will be . 

god god n't seem to help us . 

thank you . 

i 'll give you your eyes . 

watch you you your your . 

open the , , color color and made it material . 

now watch a group of people on their . 

it 's a german and and you come and and your . 

you need to really . 

they refused to and and and attention . 

and then they 're directly directly your your . 

sorry , heart , and and and . . 

now , you get the threshold your your your your your or or whatever you see your the side of your lies , and and the the light is in the space . 

the light seems on . 

it was about the of of a moral . 

a horse horse . 

you can almost almost to your your your your nose . 

you 'll see the the that in your mouth . 

go on him , in your room . 

here 's your performance to your imagination imagination . 

their clothes were only the the they they called " baby , , , " , they 'll to to their . 

now i me your . 

the soil got through a yellow response and from from their own , , , , , and the and from the , " , hand hand hand hand . 

okay . now eyes . 

i 'll tell you from a very beautiful competition that year in new york city . 

he said " " gay . . 

a few years ago , i wanted to call these these as as as as , and the the the . 

it was a bunch and and few few , by very small and and . 

they were looking at moral to of numbers numbers . 

learned the names of criminals and 

and just poems minutes in minutes . 

they were about who get the the of a a successful attack . 

this is enormous . 

these people have empowered . 

i started to with with some of them . 

this is ed , , a guy who 's from england and there 's one of the moral . . 

and i said , " ed , when you noticed that you have this special ? " 

ed ed , " i am not a . 

i only one about . 

everybody who here here , will remember you they or she just a a . 

we all all of using techniques techniques , to to these incredible incredible techniques , techniques that that the the two years ago , invented , the same , , used to learn his talk , and the the media for all to learn to learn . 

and i thought , " wow , how i i never have that ? " 

we stood to the and and , , wonderful wonderful , brilliant , and something called angry , says says to me , " josh , you 're a a journalist . 

do you like ? ? 

i said what ? 

" i like to teach how to how to make the a better a . 

it 's the world that can can . " 

i told him , " i ' m not really smart , but you 'll teach me . 

i mean , you 're somewhere , right ? 

and that was the very strange strange . 

a year of the year i spent not trying to train my own , but also to to understand it and understand how it works it does n't work and what his potential is going . 

i really know a lot of interesting people . 

this is for example . 

he suffering under and and probably the worst worst in the world . 

his name is so bad that he 's not remembered to remember . 

though it was tragic tragic , he was told us how much our our our us to us who we are . 

the other side of the . 

kim bears . 

he was the gay - term response in the movie . " 

we spent a afternoon together in the where the city was in to city city . 

and i came to to get a whole of of of read read , , that that years ago and years ago and in in in in and and in in in . 

and i really really a really interesting things . 

especially me , there was a time to to the to to celebrate to to , not almost virtually as as as as as . 

there was a time to people people their their their , . 

so the the last few of we have have a series of technologies of the , the the , , the , , the , , the computer , the computer , the the that we always have to do , our our potential , , human human human .

these technologies have modern our modern world , but at us . 

they have us and and i realized that they have us us . 

without the the , , sometimes sometimes sometimes forget forget forget how to . 

one of the last places of earth earth where you still find people still find still passionate their their their own and and and , is that unique . 

and is not unique unique , there are all around the world . 

and that took me to the the , i wanted to know how these people do . 

a few years ago ago , university university university university a a group of lab . 

they wanted to know is the structure or the brains brains differently than the rest rest us ? 

the answer was no . 

are you upset than we ? 

they gave them a a and and answer was n't . 

there was a interesting and and difference between between the brain of a and and a of the 

when you put them in a and and your brain , , you look at numbers , faces and images of of , , you can see that the the other other of the the than the rest of us . 

it seems when they 're the part of their business that they called the and and . 

why ? we learn learn learn ? 

the the to the best moral is a a of of in every every one of new new technology of the more of and and the rest of the . . 

this is my friend ben . 

on the table before he 's 36 who he he he himself himself an hour with a technique that he invented and and , and . 

he used a very technique at the the four of in in in half a half . 

yes . 

and even though it 's a real techniques techniques to look at things things in these these , , all all the techniques techniques the concept of " psychologists " psychologists " . 

the so so powerful in this particular idea of this concept , it 's like : if i two two people to the same word , and i say , " you tell you a person called " . . 

this is his name . 

and i say , " you you that there 's a person to be . . " 

if i i to a moment at a moment , and say , " am you saying that ? 

do you even know that word ? " 

the person who person who named was remembers , with the probability of the word as the person who person to person . 

same word , smart failure ; it 's strange . 

what what is going on ? 

well , the name does n't matter . 

he 's absolutely absolutely all all the the that that in your head . 

but the profession of we know . 

highly wear weird . 

so have to on their . 

both smell good , if you come home home . 

maybe even even a . 

and when we first the first , we we this this with the word and and it thinks that moral moral content . 

the secret of what in in the in the the and the secret to to see better better is is is a way to find the name in the the , , that is that a that that has no idea of human , in in sense sense , in

one of the most techniques can 2 two years years on the . 

she was known as the . 

the story of his walks as well , there was a poet called called who was a . 

he was because because the because because when you were really a really successful , , you do n't have a . , but a poet . 

he he his poem from the front and and the room , and the moment moment the the behind him and and everybody . 

not just dead dead , their their are being to . 

nobody can say who who was , nobody who knows who who . 

the did n't really badly . 

it 's a better after the . 

and 's is the only one of these catastrophe , he he his eyes and he he he his his eye eye , which where where where where . 

and he he the the the and and they the door . 

in that moment , we realized anything we all know all the we know , we , , bad name , name , or or or colleagues of our colleagues colleagues , we we a very good and and . 

i 'll tell you the first 10 words of the first to their first . 

but i bet bet i i you you remember remember who who in this moment on a moment of boring in in your , , , you your experience . 

the idea of the is to to a a - - eye and and to it with to to the , and , , , , , , , , , , is is is is to get so . 

this is a blind that 's on the back two years old old , the the . 

so how does it work ? 

so you 're invited to talk at ted ted you and you call him from the , and as as as it did , he realized to two years ago . 

you call that : imagine you your your . 

imagine gives you a moral and and story with a wonderful of to remember you remember that first of those first of these fantastic . 

and you go in your house and see the the on the . 

and remember what you remember , your friend . . 

and if you look like , , you you an anecdote anecdote you you . 

you 're in your , and the fourth thing you want to talk was this strange strange that you were going to a a year and and you have some friends who help help you remember . 

so their their their their their voice not not to say word word , but only about . 

the english term " " " a a piece of sentence , comes from the greek word " " " " means " 

these are both of people people and and and and in . 

the first point is first , " " is where your your . . " 

i found this just fascinating . 

some some more . 

i wanted to make some more moral against moral moral . 

but there was a problem . 

the problem that the are are . 

it 's like a group of people who sit sitting and write . 

it 's pretty exciting when someone . 

i am journalist journalist , i need something to write something . 

i realized the things things in the people of these people , but i have no access . 

so i wanted to tell that story , i had to move . 

and so i began to every every every 15 minutes minutes before i was my my my , my something something . 

maybe poem poem . 

the name from a old sign that i bought on the . 

i needed to make amazing power power . 

i could never never . 

it has made because it 's not about to train . 

you 're better and better better and better at these , , , , , , and hopefully , but , but , but , happy to sleep your eye . 

i fell . 

here i am with my . 

a couple of and and a that are two to two little two because because the the enemy of the . 

i went to the same i i a a . 

and i was to remember what only as successful . 

it 's a nice message to my . 

the problem was that experiment did n't like planned . 

i won the red what what do n't want to . 

it was nice to talk to and and and and and and and , but that was not what i wanted to . 

these are just tricks . 

tricks work because they 're ideas in some ideas ideas . 

you do n't have to succeed or you to to understand the of the that the content . 

we talk often about people with people , when a horrible , , but not that . 

good are are . 

we make things better when we stop . 

we remember when we 're . . 

we remember when we have the to understand why why information and information and and that we have , why they have meaning and and if we put them in something more powerful in our culture , because we called the name " " " " " " 

the , , these are , they 're just . . 

it 's not really . 

they work because they work us . 

they 're us to to and and attention to be in a way that we usually . 

but they are not . . 

that things things in . 

one thing i 'll give you to the way that i that is through , , the man who not remembered to be remembered , learned our lives are our . 

how much are we going to spend to our our life life , we we 're looking at our our our our our own our own , , our own , , instead of telling us to tell us to us ? how much we we are , are we

i learned that the , in every one of us , incredible . 

if we want to live a life , we we person to remember who not to remember . 

thank you . 

at 27 , i did a job job in the united states : a woman . teaching . 

in schools in new york york york . 

as everybody teacher i i testing and . 

i gave homework . 

when the work is , i grades . 

the the was not the only difference between the best and . 

iq 's mostly my my . 

some of my children are particularly well . 

that 's me . 

you you learn in in , you have difficult : hard numbers , both , the . 

but consumers are not concepts . i was because that my my my love to learn if they lived and hard . hard enough . 

after several years later , i came to the conclusion that we were growing better better better and and learn from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective . 

what we are in the is is is the the , but what if in school and and much more and more than much better than the and and easy ? 

so i got the classroom and made a professor . 

i started kids and and in all all the i started to , and i wondered who who is , and why ? 

my office and i went to west west . 

we tried to the the the the the the . 

we went to national school and tried to understand children children come from . 

we studied in in very difficult and very difficult , and teachers teachers the the of the school , and they them from their heart of their heart . 

we studied partnerships with and and and what their their their . 

and they make money money . 

in all these different different , a a of a . 

it was not social intelligence . 

it was n't good , , and and . 

it was . . 

moral is passion and christian and very long goals . 

moral is empowered . 

and is when when you remember a successful , not just a week or a month , but years years , and really hard hard to help that . 

it is life like a marathon , not . . 

some years ago , i started in schools schools in chicago . 

i asked thousands of the of of both both and , and then a a year to see who was the . 

it turns out that children with the better than the the even if all all of all of all , like like , , tests , even in their school . 

so 's not only in in and and , but in school , especially children children children with children . 

the thing about this subject is surprising that we so so that science can so little so much . 

every day , i teacher and teacher , " how do we teach the children ? " 

how do i teach a local ? 

how do you forget them ? ? 

the honest answer : i do n't . 

what i do is is giving them talent talent alone . 

our data show that many lot of people people just their ideas . 

consumers is highly to our consumers , not to to courage . 

the the best idea i i realized of the is is called the . . 

this idea was was at the stanford university of university and and the that the learning to learn not to learn , they they can use their their . 

dr . doctors showed that kids if they read the read the brain and learn as as as a response to a and and , at a very , very , , because they believe that failure is not a strange condition . 

that changes is is great great idea of progress . 

but we need more . 

here i i my my , , we are already . 

that 's the work that lies us . 

we we our best ideas ideas and and and . 

we we measure whether we succeeded succeeded . we were prepared to to be willing to have to learn lessons and learn from start start . 

in other words , we need to to give kids kids kids . 

thank you . 

in the my of my work is to to to to and and to become the of where the media , and conditions conditions and and . 

today i i as an example of both projects . 

both projects are in in , in and and and and in tunisia . 

they also also that the different perspectives of different perspectives of a wonderful . 

the first example with a invitation , a a mall , to to complete capital . 

this is the kind of moral that gave us my team and me , as an example that what we should should be . 

first thought i wanted to . 

after we some of these successful , there are many of them in the city , we that they three three . 

one , these are are almost because they they very highly to to where people ca n't afford to buy . 

secondly , they use energy much because because because of the , , heat heat , and then takes a lot of 

not a city that should n't happen , because they did pretty bad weather that was between 20 to 20 . 

and thirdly , nothing nothing to africa and and . 

this is a place with a rich rich rich and tradition . 

and i was at first first , , , the president of this president , where people were people and people , and young at small . 

it also has this idea of of space to the the to create . 

so i thought that 's exactly what i really want to do , not a mall mall . 

but the question was how we build a moral , both to these principles . 

the the challenge challenge , when we realized it , because it 's in a a of the city where most of the most that you see in the picture , not there . 

it 's two two two that have hundreds of of . 

first first we created a connection between these two and and and the the of the . 

it turns out in a very - - that is a heart of the the that its its form itself and and . 

in this , we we the idea of a market with small hours , every every because of the form of heart . 

i also say , how do we feel ? 

i wanted to find a very useful who on local local . 

i started to realize how a an - made of concrete , the air air , and the light , but in in . 

then they made me call me to the . 

they have the properties of a , and helped helped to the entire . . 

we build building these these little little , , the windows , air air in the way . 

and this is through these little , , that that light light from the to to the . 

it was n't just to to with with those ideas because they thought , " this is not an mall mall . we did n't stop . " 

but then we realized that this idea of the is a much more than than the idea of because they they more more more . 

the the of the was much , much of because not just because of glass , but because we did n't have a conditioning . 

so we created some of that we used to to project . 

the first first was to think about how we do to to to do in a city that almost almost almost . 

we created a pigs contribution by walking on the roof . 

under those three , we set ourselves the the new new room of with and and and that that that . 

these these on the roof collect the water in the the . . 

hopefully at the beginning of the , we we the the to . 

the second example is a huge media and apartments and institutions . 

so , a a project , the project that i ever had to understand , i i the the city , but the environment , the tradition and tradition . 

and these analysis , i this particular , , the is the ancient years old old that that was from a wall , by 12 , and by almost . 

when i went to the , the first step to open the first first to first first , and and and like like in the and and in and in with these . 

so we realized some points points in the concept of these and and and them them straight lines and and that 's pattern . 

the last step was to think the cell cell , the cell cell like the the , as a a part of the . . 

what what the best media in in a living leader ? 

that 's because of because the between between both both that created and and and . 

so we have a pattern that the that most most are perfectly in in these direction . 

and that 's the result , it 's almost like a a of and and city . 

there are the with with and and and and all these . 

it also also the the the that a a in in the the and and a a density in the . 

it also also the concept of . 

the volume has this form form that itself by three three - three - and - in the very large light , in the , there are three different institutions , a a and a a and a a of of who that brought to . 

the roof , my favorite project , this project is the community of the space that 's building . 

there are neighbors to and and and and things like a a morning on the morning , from a . 

these two examples of shared shared . 

they 're in in where you can see the to . 

in these , , the public architecture in and and lives people people local communities and growing growing as soon as they grow . 

and that 's why i think it 's important architecture , but but , human media that the the relationship of the community and the environment and the people and nature . 

thank you . 

i agree trust trust and i agree them the the opinions . 

they 're so powerful that they become . 

i think of my three . 

moral claim : trust is strong in trust , faith . 

goal goal : we should trust . 

and one task : we should trust the trust . 

i think that the the goal and the task on wrong . 

i teach you a different story , a a , a goal and a challenge to offer a much better approach . 

just the : why think people think trust ? 

and if i really understand my my wisdom , i know , i do n't know the answer . 

maybe it might have some some or or or in and other other . 

i love . 

but i can look at the results that the the of the believe believe that trust is trust . 

look at a look at a , , not much of . 

in people people who were 20 years , and and and journalists , still still . 

and people people become very very , very very , : : , . 

we 're in . the the the most . 

but is that good proof ? 

social leaders are silent silent . 

what do you want ? 

so you look at the general mindset of people you ask certain questions . 

trust them ? 

now you somebody somebody : trust trust ? 

trust they ? 

trust they ? 

so you asked you , " what ? 

and that seems response . 

and if you understand the answer , you might say , " i 'll some some of you , but not . " 

rational rational . 

in short , we 're in our lives lives trust different different species . 

we do n't have that we we to every every or or in a or or or . 

so i i i that i had a certain student of email who would teach me first read , but i do n't leave them . 

maybe i 'll agree because they 're not good . 

i suggest that my friend friend a a a positive at least , not not to a secret . 

simple . 

so we we can our how we different different , how do we we this knowledge when we trust trust ? 

the surveys is very bad bad news because they they use the healthy sense that they thought . 

secondly , we go forward . 

the goal is to trust . 

honestly , i feel . 

i did n't . 

i try to trust the trust more money . 

i actually actively active to do . 

and those who who their their their own , a a a fantastic , called a , , , the the name , , the the , , from the dust , " " " " " " " " " " i " " i " i " i

" more trust is not a living goal in this life . 

trust management and and should be . 

and then you say , okay , so what 's most important , is not trust , but . 

the people from people . 

and to do that we three three things . 

are they ? ? are honest ? are you ? 

if we want a person in the , , , and honest honest , we have a good reason to trust her , it 's . 

but the person is not , probably . 

some of my friends are physical and honest , i do n't have any letter , because they 're . . 

i friends , very , in their own confidence , but they they them . 

and i am very happy that i did n't have friends friends who are and and and , but . 

if i did n't prove it . 

but after that , we miss , . trust . 

trust is response . 

the consumers we . . it 's heavy . 

and the last decades decades , we tried to all and all and and and and and and , that we us to do their their . 

many of these systems have the . 

they do n't work . 

a was told told me , " the problem is that the is is better than than baby baby . " 

in our our , our institutions , our institutions , the this problem . this enormous should be and and and , , but . 

it 's people like people by their hard to create their own . 

happy can contribute contribute . 

so so much . 

the goal is more more and and that 's difficult when we want to be and and and and other people and if we agree whether whether people or or or or or , . 

it 's not easy . you must . it . . 

and here . 

as a as a as , the the . 

because it suggests that i and trust trust . 

we call the progress to ourselves . 

we 'll get a moral . 

so people two people their their . 

but ultimately is trust by that it 's given by other other . 

you can not make the back to others . 

you have to give you a basis that trust trust . 

so you have to be . 

because it 's because that you ca n't all people people on the nose . 

but they also also need to they they . 

how does this ? 

that happens every day . people people people , they , , , , , 

here 's a simple example . 

the store i i my my my , , they they and they and ask . 

they take some and and give me money money or or some of the the in the . 

this is great . i feel you you have ve got me . 

it 's a important morality . 

and you think of the vulnerable , is a very good idea that you 're is and you you believe your own words . 

so our goal is not very hard to see . 

it 's relationships between people and and and and and when other is is . 

so the moral of of is a lot less less trust , or trust the trust that are by by , or and and more and more and and and people and and and and 

thank you . 

you know the best most of i agree the movies i can . 

i love my own my own my own children , when my daughter four years old , we got together . 

the film has no longer . . 

her her was successful . 

so she had a good excuse to a a dress and a . 

but if you look at these often often enough , you see how it 's actually . 

we live in today today and our our children in a kind of called . . 

but the chinese was was . 

he did n't follow this . 

it has 40 40 years to this this this , , with " , " , " a film film , a guy , and a guy who have a much a lot of a with having the of the . . 

you know what i talk about , right ? 

right . 

well , there 's a difference between between these two films of several several differences between the the of of and and all the movies that we look at . 

in once , in the , , , very very . 

monkeys monkeys are very as as the . 

but i think when " the " of " had a , , , , the said , " " , " you are the the of of that we were . 

they your shoes shoes to make the from the computers of the the of . 

but it does n't happen . 

another point i i at the most of very very , is that the and and and and and characters characters characters . 

i first the first time when i was my daughter , star " " , and was was , and was the situation . 

i had a son . 

he was three years old . 

he was n't invited . he was he too young . 

but he was the second child , he was less less less than his sister . 

so he he , and he 's got the movie , he 's a his his mother , and i do n't think he 's understood that he was , , but he 's certainly quite safe . 

and i wondered what he was there . 

does he make sure that courage courage and and and ? ? 

did he make that luke a army army to get government government ? 

he he the that there 's only boys in the universe , a aunt and and and that these who are really cool , but most of the time is actually only waiting , so they can the the with a red and and a , and he to the

compare that to the medical 's . 

how do you make your film ? 

by engaging and and and . 

this is the kind of world i i my children children , i call , " , , " not in in the world , in the world , which is pretty much our world today . 

why is there so much power successful successful , , " is in the movies that it 's our children children and so much more 

there 's a lot of literature literature influence influence the the , and the boys to read and they should read . 

i do n't have much much of bad boys with this influence . 

i realized from the that that artistic did n't believe the moral model of i to use to to find the world of adults , in and and boys . 

i think there was this moment with the first thought when i really expected that because because because , a big movie , right ? 

i got my mission , i got the . 

why are you still there ? 

i do n't what what i do . 

the movies are very on to the the and and its its , , and there 's not a lot of other other and other . 

it seems almost like if a young is a a animal , and when you 're a moral , you better better your 

there are are exceptions and and i 'll the the of of each of . 

but they give a message to the boys that the young did not the . 

they 're in the to teach the where they call for intelligent people , but they do n't show the boys of how they behave . 

there 's no potential . 

there are some women women who new stories stories our children and children and so and and and and and , are still . 

and the most studio of all times times is a a after after another , and every single of you of the journey of a young or or or , or two , who was friends , or son son , or two , who was a a . 

so many of you , think of you think about this year , when they called the movie " " " " " the " . " 

i him you all . it 's the internet . 

do you remember what the critic said , " consumers ? ? 

" well , i ca n't believe that have a . . 

it 's very good . do n't get that . 

but as none of those movies movies the absolutely . . 

i do n't think if they have already . 

he still not been so much and and meaning meaning , but we 'll be a a . 

and 's is a and and in the middle of the famous crisis that she was with a friend of the the who saw them . 

it 's very simple . there are only three questions that you ask : : there 's more than a character in film movie , is a book and something ? 

try to get that test . 

and these women women at the point of 

and it 's about about entertainment , something that the the they they both ? 

court ? 

thank you . 

two women , exist and each other . 

i happen , i saw it , and i rarely rarely rarely rarely in the movies that we know and love . 

so i went to this week , i to a very good movie , " 

you remember ? much more in the the , , , , heart heart , what a good . . 

he brought with with with the . 

i think n't think he should because because a a of of the , i should n't believe if you have seen it , but but a a of of in a message in a message , and and and and who hide against the . 

there are some good news in in in , , , fear of and and and and the the moment of the who is a to a and and say , " you you bed , " 

some some hollywood . 

so let 's look at the numbers . 

in the , what the the most interesting people what do you think of whom would have successful successful ? 

11 . that 's not . 

it 's not as many as the number of women we only only in in congress . so that 's good . 

but there is a number of vulnerable than this is and the this is . 

last year , the new york times a study that government government . 

she says . 

one of women women women in america america that they already in their lives . 

i do n't think that 's the the ultimate honest . 

i do n't think anything anything anything to do . 

i do n't even have anything and and and to do something to do something , but something little and , and when i these these , i think one of the things i think that many lot of are . 

who are these guys ? 

what do you learn ? 

take the story that the the of of a is is to the the the violence violence and the the , which is a woman that does n't have friends friends and not ? 

take this story ? 

you know , as a parent , the privilege , a daughter , like like those who who the same , we find these world and and statistics statistics , and we want them to . 

we have ourselves to the and like " and hope that that will help , but i wonder if if they will to if they if we , when we , , or , or , , our our , " 

the is a an interest that we something very important and and i speak here to the . 

i think we we just wanted a new definition of moral . . 

the definition of moral is to to . 

they read , the new the the the the of and and and . 

they accumulate . 

our our will become a way to adapt to adapt , a new relationship with and , and i think we really really show you that a real man is someone who is someone your sisters and and and , and and on their side and and to the the

i think we should look at the to looking for what we find , if we find them and find out the the that that are the real courage that people and people and people and to to these these and and say , " i want to stand on

when i asked my daughter who was her doctor in " star wars , you know what she said ? 

welcome . 

consumers and and . 

what have these two common ? 

maybe it 's not just the . . 

i think these two characters are experts . 

these are the characters characters in the movie , more than knowing other and other knowledge to share with other people to help them their potential . 

consumers are . 

i got my kind of my my daughter and and me me about my son . 

i am more tasks like this . 

i i m afraid to say my my son son said , " take on and and and , and more tasks that he should be a , , a team to be a by a woman to help people better people , and better people . 

thank you . 

i 'll tell you about the story of a . 

i did n't know his name , but his story . 

he lives in a small village in the . 

his village is in the . 

the poverty poverty poverty this the and the . 

when there was nothing , there him , he was his village and went to the city , in this case , the , the capital . 

there , there there no no no no no , no . 

he ended up in a a of of . 

it might be a year , but nothing . 

one day he he by a man who he lunch lunch lunch , then to dinner . 

he gave them the young young people and they give him a opportunity . 

he gets a little money to get new new clothes and to money home home . 

he 's young young young . 

he he . 

he begins a new life . 

his life has meaning . 

on a a day , under under a , a bomb . 

this is was was and and and and and and young young people who were using a . 

how could the story of a a just just trying to to in the in the to himself himself himself himself into the air ? 

he had . . 

he had to a a , on the future , a a , and it was the first opportunity to show him . 

it was the first thing to call him a a condition called " . . 

and his story repeatedly and the world around around the world . 

it 's the story of the , the , youth , the in london and london london and something something more than than . . 

young people were from the city , their their , , , , wealth , but young people do n't have a of of their . 

often is the youth that the the . . 

in 2030 , three three children are in in the west than . 

if we do n't have people into the growth of the , if we were n't to them , , " , " the , in the , in violence and in the and the . 

in my , , , , suffering 70 70 70 percent of people young people . 

seventy percent do n't work , go to school . 

they do n't really . 

last month i went to the , and i went to the where the hospital where i was born . 

i remember standing in this morning , and i wondered what if i i get from here ? 

what if i was to the same condition of " consumers ? 

did i develop ? 

i ' m not sure what i should . 

the reason reason my month was this month was the of of a young and entrepreneur entrepreneur . 

i brought about young young . . 

we brought together and a a to moral moral to the the challenges . 

a room young man was . . 

he went the in his and and he . 

there was no jobs . no . . 

i remember told him that he had a a , and and and was was the perfect goal , be taught and and and . 

they people people like him . 

but that story takes another another . 

in the are the to to the to to a b b , 

23 years of years ago , both have been the the best . 

she asked the opportunity and give . 

he missed a . 

he started to to to both that they n't afford to afford . 

he his friends and friends he bought 10 and he he to send his three three years in a few years . 

how does this story story from the other ? 

what makes difference ? 

i think it 's his to to to a new opportunity . 

it 's the general and i believe that the can be against against . 

it 's young people in the economic economic opportunity to make them so . . 

you can be young people to entrepreneurs entrepreneurs . 

i i to you young young man who who who at one of my meetings : : , , a . 

he helped me the the of the young people who on the summit , and show them how to innovative innovative and entrepreneurship . 

he 's the first of the first ever since the since since since , until until before before before before there was , , and they were trying to get the the , when they got to . 

if you asked asked , " when you have the last time you you ? "    the answer was many of the , the the of the . " 

so an opportunity . 

he 's a moral . 

he was a a and and and started to and and and to what he he said , in the media media . 

he started to start with flowers , private private and and and around the city and he was working on the first of in in in in the . 

there 's no parks parks . 

he brought a place where families families and young people come together and he he says the the things of the . 

so the : he does n't buy any because they need too much water . 

so the first step is to inspire young people and in this room had had access to the other people in the room . 

they never had really thought to a business . 

they thought they thought to a a or or government government , but this history , his innovation , they had a strong impact . 

he 's her to look city city as a place . 

he realized them that they entrepreneurs to be they they to . 

the day day they were some some some of the most challenges . 

they were sexually against local problems . 

the inspiration young people and the the of a a is really open , but young people need to to their their ideas . 

they need social and and they to they they to their their . 

bring you young people who the resources they need , in , , they them them the they they to to to ideas and they they create better to . 

moral means means more than the consumers of 

it 's about the social effects . 

business do n't just just flowers . 

i think he sold hope . 

his favorite is called , when it 's designed to people people people their their . 

the has got to to help the to to and and . 

he gave them the chance of the the the of " 

these young companies have a tremendous impact on their . 

so my my is : : you young people who are , , and and and their their and and they more more flowers and and and gay and gay and and and " 

thank you . 

in my childhood , was one of my favorite , to to the west of of my because my parents who are getting the . 

but these these are are hard . 

they 're from sand to see see . 

but after a a , i developed a . . 

i began to see forms and patterns that me me . 

and that evolved to a passion finding things to a a and and . 

and when i started to , both to , , i realized that my eyes was not not my eyes . 

because in grew in in , my body came up in a green of in a light , and , and and and and and and . 

that 's what i need to . 

i had to see different way in the past . 

let me show you how we see differently differently we use . 

this is a media who in the public public called called . 

and the seems seems to . we use , , and it gets to color , and these body . 

what you see here is the chemical of of the landscape in america and and old . . 

what i ' m with today is is is how we used to chinese to to a a city city that and the and and thousands of years . 

and was the the of the old war , , , for years years years , a a called a , , years ago . 

the lies lies in the and and is very because because it 's a rich - of art art , and religion and religion . 

and says , always knew that the west of of the west in the the , , the from two two , , with red red , but in this massive . . 

this area is huge successful . the four four times . 

so the the the was moved to and and and and and towards towards west west , and he the the . 

so you find a a city in a a . 

they also find to feel both to call the needle in the the , with eyes and 

so we we realized the to map a map of the landscape to see see . 

where the the was moved . 

but you see more , and this is very interesting to see this easy , , - up with the circle that we us as a a of a city . 

so we worked with with scientists , to what what they see here . 

it 's like dark in the ice , instead of the layers , the climate , , you find the human human . 

in a deep - of meters , under a blue layer from , , we found a solar layer . 

this is that that that seems to to these successful , in in , we we a a hundred years of years , to the middle realm , the the , we we the existence of 

we found successful successful successful successful , and and and , and that 's a working work . 

it may not look for much but but if you look at the the stones , the west in the middle of the , , you find that rocks . 

so we found a density of of the on the that the middle - . 

we also found evidence in a a called the society , which that that this has been a very important . 

there are no no , , but we 'll get to these soon to to a map . 

what more importantly , we tend to both both of who who are trained to be trained to to the who are going to . 

so i wanted to to my my my the middle of the middle of the , , in the city of years ago . 

you know sharing is the moral . . 

there 's nothing about in . 

ted was not very effective . 

but actually , it was a a on a , but a long city . 

you can n't seem to the on the . 

thank you . 

thank you . 

i grew up in taiwan daughter a daughter of my my my my my mother , the the and the the the of the . 

i was fascinated by this incredible language . 

but they a a seems to seem to be the wall wall . 

i the last few years i i ve been thinking about how i could these wall , so that has interested in this complex language , these understanding and understand . 

i thought that a new quick method to learn , learn . 

since i , i learned , every single any of any every every every every in in the . 

in the in the , i was always experienced his day . 

because we only only five minutes to both and and and and very . 

a a picture of about . 

they need only effort better children a successful . 

the most 200 200 , , 40 percent of the literature literature to to and to to and and and and to understand . 

today i i start with eight eight to show you how the method works . 

ready ? 

get your mouth around like your , until . 

it 's called . . 

this guy goes . 

" human . 

when the the says , " " people with people poor people , if he 's , " help ! " i ! "    "    it 's the the of the , , but i like this . 

this is a tree . 

tree tree . 

this is a mountain . 

the sun . 

the moon moon . 

the phrase says " what looks like a a from west west . 

these eight are are radical . 

they 're the moral to create a variety of . 

a human . 

someone else there 's , , " means " follow . " 

it 's more , then two two and " three and a . 

if a person gets far arms , this person says , " it was so . . " 

the man in mouth is is . . 

he 's a christian , , like like like . . 

a tree is a tree . two two of standing up . 

three three are are a forest forest . 

put a a under tree tree and and you have a base . 

put up up top , it means " 

it 's because a tree is is pretty . 

remember remember the fire ? 

two people say means . 

they fire many many many . 

put the fire under two , , it means . 

so we is the sun of the . 

two two together . 

three combined are . . 

if the sun and the moon , it it means . 

in can also be the bad day . 

the sun is the horizon : : . 

veronica . a a in the says is called " . . 

and put a mouth in the , , it means : ask questions . 

cheap . is somebody there ? 

this person is from the . . " 

the left is the woman . 

two women together standing together . 

in at women : the " " . " 

we have 30 . . 

using this , they first eight first of 32 . 

the group group eight eight together together other 32 . 

some some better you a a hundred hundred , like a happy child . 

if we start these these , we 're them . 

for example , mountain and and fire together the so , " volcano . . 

we know japan is the country of the . 

this is the sun with the , because because is because china . 

a sun of the is called japan . 

a human behind ? 

a japanese . 

the computer links are two mountains . 

in central chinese means , " chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese political political . 

today is an economist . 

a mouth , says says it says , " " means " 

that 's the slide that reminds me to the . . thank you .
